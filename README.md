This is the home of my "Fun with..." trilogy of talks.

## Episode 1: Fun with Pointers

Originally presented at Gophercon UK 2019.

In this talk you will learn how to use pointers effectively in Go. Weâ€™ll cover from the basics of pointer declaration and usage, to the implications of allocating memory on the stack versus the heap. We'll also see some practical use cases and interesting behaviours when using pointers, including when to use pointer receivers vs value receivers, unsafe package tricks and when a nil pointer is not exactly nil (hint: interfaces!).
