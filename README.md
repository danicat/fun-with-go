# Fun With Go
This is the home of my "Fun with..." trilogy of talks.

## Episode 1: Fun with Pointers

Originally presented at [Gophercon UK 2019](https://gophercon.co.uk).

In this talk you will learn how to use pointers effectively in Go. Weâ€™ll cover from the basics of pointer declaration and usage, to the implications of allocating memory on the stack versus the heap. We'll also see some practical use cases and interesting behaviours when using pointers, including when to use pointer receivers vs value receivers, unsafe package tricks and when a nil pointer is not exactly nil (hint: interfaces!).

## Episode 2: Fun with Slices

Originally presented at [GoCon 2023 (Japan)](https://gocon.jp/2023/)

Slices can be seen in almost every Go program, but many developers are still unware of how they exactly work. On the surface we might think they are simple constructs that allows us to handle multiple elements of a single type, but they are more than just a collection.

Specially for people new to Go, slices can be a source of pain because of the behaviors it possess that you wouldn't expect from a traditional dynamic array or list.

In this session we are going to do a deep dive on the slice type, starting from arrays and slice declaration syntax, slicing operations, copying, resizing and its surprising (or not) side effects.

The session will be composed most of code examples using the playground, with an eventual dive into the compiler source code to see the relevant bits of slice implementation.

## Episode 3: Fun with Generics

Originally presented at [Gophercon UK 2023](https://gophercon.co.uk)

It has been over two years since generics were introduced in Go. Have you done anything fun with it? I have! Ever since the "Creative Use of Generics Contest" at Gophercon 2021 I have been dreaming with a monads library implementation in Go. In this session I will walk you through the basics of generics, how I used it to build a monads library, the challenges, limitations and a comparison with non-generic Go. In the end, you will be the judge to the question: was it a good idea after all? 

Topics include:
- Generics syntax: types, functions, interfaces
- Generics constraints
- Monads: what they are, what they eat, where they live
- An Option type implemented in Go
